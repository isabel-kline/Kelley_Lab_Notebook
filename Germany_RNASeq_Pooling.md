# Pooling

[Drive folder link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Hol6ktlDViiKfrVa1tLDwSl3-bCFDLBG)

### Pooling Libraries Planning

❑ Enter data for each library into the pooling calculators

• Concentration (ng/uL) determined by the Qubit

• Average fragment size (bp) in the 100-1200bp region determined by previous RNA seq

❑ Adjust the targeted concentration of the pool (nM), volume, and library predilutions to satisfy conditions:

• Pipette no less than 2uL of any library (use predilutions for more concentrated libraries)

Create 4 pools of 24 samples apiece of equal nM concentration if possible

• Final pool concentration should be above 3 nM

• total pool volumes at least 30uL. ideally 50 ul

• Watch for negative total pool volume due to overdiluted libraries (reduce predilution &/or final pool concentration to avoid)

### Pooling Libraries 

24 samples at a time:

❑ Using the pooling calculator results, perform any necessary predilutions of libraries into eluant used for library prep

❑ Add the specified amount of eluant used for libary prep into a LoBind 1.5mL tube

tube labelled "Pool \# Project and \_nM Pool MM/DD/YY with initials on the side

❑ Carefully add the specified volume of each library to the tube. Accurate pipetting is essential, & use

multiple methods to track libraries added to the pool (e.g. pattern of pipette tips in rack, closing each tube

as you go, checking off each library volume on a hard copy of the pooling calculator results).

Once the pool has been created, store leftover libraries at -20C.

The pool may be stored at -20C for future use

Combine pools 1:1:1:1

The pool may be stored at -20C until shipped out for sequencing
