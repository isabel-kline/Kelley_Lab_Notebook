# Summary

### Overview 

The total RNA was then normalized and the mRNA fraction was enriched via the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module. Subsequently the samples were prepared for sequencing using the NEBNext® Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® and indexed using the NEBNext® Multiplex Oligos for Illumina. The protocol followed for library preparation modified fragment time to 10 minutes at 94 C, extended the first strand cDNA synthesis incubation 42 C incubation time to 50 minutes and limited the PCR cycles to 10.

## method idiosyncrasies

-   PCR cycles: 10

    *perhaps if aiming for insert of 300 bp, should bump cycles up by 1 or two*

# Log

### 07/09/24

32 libraries. 7 samples yield was 20 ng or less. Consider these libraries to be failures.

It seems like the 3rd strip of samples had something occurr during processing that inhibited them.

possible causes:

-   didn't add a reagent to a strip of samples?

-   kit efficacy fell off?

next steps: process 8 samples only in next batch and see what happens
