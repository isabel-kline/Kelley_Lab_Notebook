### Planning

Extraction plan: Dry Ice Cryofracture of Tissues and Circulomics HMW DNA Extraction kit with modifications

-   aim for up to 50 mg of sample input

-   200 ul and 400 ul of cold Buffer CT (respectively in OOO, both below std amount)

-   centrifuge spins will be at 10G

-   warm EB to 70C to improve yield

##### Sequencing strategy

*Sample will be sent to Davis for Pac Bio Sequencing I assume*

Buffer CW1 and CW2 are supplied as concentrates.\
This kit uses CW1 & CW2 a 60% final ethanol concentration.\
Before using, add the appropriate amount of ethanol\
(96–100%) to Buffer CW1 and Buffer CW2 as indicated on the bottles

### April 18, 2024

Sample was stored in the -80, removed and thawed on ice on 4/12/24, and placed in the 4C until today's extraction.

A portion of the muscle sample was apportioned, weighed and cryofractured. Protocol execution was unremarkable.

#### Next Steps

QC on 4/20/24

### April 19, 2024

Made a 1:5 dilution of HMW sample using 2 ul of sample and 8 ub EB

consumed 1 ul of dilution for HS dsDNA Qubit Quantitative assessment, consumed 2 ul of dilution for uDrop Qualitative assessment

Based on results of Qubit decided to consume 1 ul of undiluted sample for Tapestation fragment analysis

decided to put undiluted Gar HMW sample in thermomixer set at 24 C. Jellies of unsolubilized DNA still appeared present in tube. Per recco's of std protocol 2 hours additional time at RT should help with solubilization. Will want to redo quant and qual with fresh dilution post incubation.

### April 22, 2024

Made a second 1:5 aliquot of the Gar HMW sample using 2 ul of sample and 8 ub EB

Redid Qubit and udrop and did additional nanodrop qualitative assessment

consumed 6 ul of 1:5 for qubit, udrop and nanodrop QC

results showed a low 260/230 and a decent A260/280

Notes:

might have transferred the " waxy or opaque residue" during step 20 of the extraction... Transfer up to 300 μL of supernatant thinking it was the gel like matrix of DNA.

Potential solves for the low 260/230 include the 3.1x Bead Size Selection or the Genomic DNA Clean & Concentrator®-10 or a redo of the extraction.

### April 23, 2024

To address the low 260/230 will be doing a 3.1x bead cleanup on the sample

*Also want sample concentration to be above 100 ng/ul post clean up*

Have 70 ul of 88ng/ul sample = 6.6 micrograms.

Assuming 20% loss from bead cleanup will have 4.9 micrograms post clean up

32 ul should give a concentration of 150 ng/ul

#### Next Steps

### Notes

Tissue selection: Fish skeletal muscle is not recommended if other fish tissues are available (e.g., heart, testes, fin clip, kidney)

Double input of sample if using skeletal muscle. Still a good candidate b/c parasite fraction might be lower
