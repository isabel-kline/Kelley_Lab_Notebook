# Overview

The gill tissue samples were homogenized in MP Bio Matrix A tubes using a Fast Prep 5G with cool prep adapter. Gill arch RNA was then extracted using the NEB monarch total RNA MiniPrep kit following the standard tissue protocol for the kit.

# Summary

Poecilia gillii gills - Only the control and hypoxic samples to be run.

Total amount: 48 samples stored in RNA Later solution.

Extraction plan:

-   Gills - Cryofracture in Lysing Matrix A tubes using coolPrep adapter for 45 sec at a speed setting of 6.5 m/s. NEB spin column RNA extraction.

-   batches of 8 or 12

Month of Experiment: 8/24

# Input v Yield



# *Exp29_Protocol*

-   *put lysis buffer in tubes prior to transfer of samples*

-   *place reagents on columns prior to removal of under waste to avoid drying out column*

-   *incubate all washes/primers for a time after addition onto column prior to spin.*

    -   *found that 1 min for most things worked well.*

    -   *for final wash incubated was at RT for 3 min prior to 2 min spin*

-   *nix repeat elution step. of note: accidental elution volume of 114 ul had a 1.3x yield recovery compared to sample input of similar sized samples. Maybe larger elution volume would be beneficial for increased yield*
