# Overview

Poecilia gillii tissues - Only the control and hypoxic samples to be run.

48 samples were stored in RNALater solution.

Tissue Box Label: BWR24_001 to Costa Rica RNALater filled 12/06/23

*The gill arch samples were homogenized in MP Bio Matrix A tubes using a Fast Prep 5G with cool prep adapter. Gill arch RNA was then extracted using the NEB monarch total RNA MiniPrep kit following the standard tissue protocol for the kit with one modification, a proteinase K incubation time of 30 minutes. Brain samples were homogenized in MP Bio Matrix D tubes using a Fast Prep 5G with cool prep adapter. Brain RNA was then extracted using the NEB monarch total RNA MiniPrep kit following the standard tissue protocol for the kit.*

Extraction plan:

-   *Gills - Cryofracture in Lysing Matrix A tubes using coolPrep adapter for 45 sec at a speed setting of 6.5 m/s. NEB spin column RNA extraction. 30 min pro K incubation*

-   *Brain- Cryofracture in Lysing Matrix D tubes using coolPrep adapter for 20 sec at a speed setting of 4 m/s. NEB spin column RNA extraction std protocol*

Month of Experiment: 8/24

# Input v Yield



# *Exp##\_Protocol*

-   *put lysis buffer in tubes prior to transfer of samples*

-   *place reagents on columns prior to removal of under waste to avoid drying out column*

-   *incubate all washes/primers for a time after addition onto column prior to spin.*

    -   *found that 1 min for most things worked well.*

    -   *for final wash incubated was at RT for 3 min prior to 2 min spin*

-   *nix repeat elution step. of note: accidental elution volume of 114 ul had a 1.3x yield recovery compared to sample input of similar sized samples. Maybe larger elution volume would be beneficial for increased yield*

#### Plan for extractions

-   "bury" the sample in the lysing matrix A garnet flakes. Observed supernatant that was less clear then the 1st batch juvenile supernatants post cryofracture

-   add buffers (priming buff, wash buff) on top of columns prior to removing waste below to avoid drying out the columns.

-
