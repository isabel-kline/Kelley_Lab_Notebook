# Overview

Drive folder link

Extracted total RNA was normalized and the mRNA fraction was enriched via the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module. The samples were prepared for sequencing using the NEBNext® Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® and indexed using the NEBNext® Multiplex Oligos for Illumina. The protocol followed for library preparation modified fragment time to 10 minutes at 94 C, extended the first strand cDNA synthesis incubation 42 C incubation time to 50 minutes and limited the PCR cycles to 10. 

# Summary

Gills, sample count: 24.

remixed order from extraction order

normalization prior to Library prep : 1 ug input
