# Summary

### Overview

Lycodes Concolor Gill Tissue was sourced from the Ocean Genome Legacy

details: sample A27970: gill in EDTA solution, flash frozen, put into the -80

[Drive folder link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18Grc9RU8b1AgnpR51Xi0QxQu8HY615x5?usp=drive_link)

### Planning

Extraction plan: Circulomics HMW DNA Extraction kit with modifications

-   aim for up to 50 mg of sample input

-   200 ul and 400 ul of cold Buffer CT (respectively in OOO, both below std amount)

-   centrifuge spins will be at 10G

-   warm EB to 70C to improve yield, incubate at 37c during elution for 15 min 2x

Sample might have to be spun down slowly - *slurry concerns*

-   might cryofracture
-   depending on how slurry the sample is post centrifugation skip removal of supernatant

##### Sequencing strategy

*Sample will be sent to Davis for Pac Bio Sequencing*

# Log

### 4/15/24

SB and I went to -80 to look at OGL sample. Observed sample to be frozen in EDTA.

#### Q's

-   should we thaw the sample, spin it down gently \*(what speed/duration is this) and remove the EDTA prior to cryofracture?

-   what will happen when we spin down the gill once thawed..will it produce a slurry?

-   after removal of EDTA should a PBS wash be done

    -   what effects could EDTA have on the downstream extraction steps? *improve yield?*

#### Next Steps

SB will email Rosie from the OGL to ask if this is a situation that she has insight on and what if any steps does she perform when a sample is flash frozen in EDTA

MIOK - read <https://brieflands.com/articles/amhsr-113043>

EDTA was removed form sample by spinning down tooth powder at 10 g for 3 minutes, the supernatant was then discarded and protease buffer was directly added to sample to start extraction.

results indicated that EDTA incubation had a better DNA yield than water buffer

### 4/16/24

Rosie recco's: *"centrifuge, remove supernatant, and go straight to extraction. The EDTA solution should not interfere with extraction. We have had success extracting DNA straight from EDTA when tissue was too dissolved to be removed from the solution."*

4c Centrifuge was prechilled and sample removed from the -80 to thaw on ice.

When the sample was thawed I transferred it from the cryovial to a 2ml Protein lo bind tube with a wide pipette tip and spun it down at 3G for 1.5min. I saw a good amount of intact tissue so I went ahead and transferred the EDTA supernatant to a 2ml protein lo bind tube for just in case.

-   From there I weighed out the sample and had 53.2 mg.

    -   EDTA tissue supernatant was put in the 4C.

-   Proceeded to cryofracture with 5x hits and continued on with protocol

-   Got to overnight RT rest of elution

#### Next Steps

QC 4/17/24 - qubit and uDrop

### 4/17/24

took out 10 ul of sample to create a QC aliquot

from QC aliquot. took out 2 ul for a 1:5 ul dilution QC aliquot

Qubit and uDrop completed on a 1:5 dilution of eluted sample and undiluted sample

sample submission requirements for multiplexed Davis Pac Bio sequencing have been met

<https://dnatech.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/sample-requirements/>

Zymo Research DNA Elution Buffer is 10 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 0.1 mM EDTA

The composition of Buffer EB is: 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5

#### Next Steps

Run Tapestation with Gar HMW extraction

### Notes

Tissue selection: Fish skeletal muscle is not recommended if other fish tissues are available (e.g., heart, testes, fin clip, kidney)

Double input of sample if using skeletal muscle. Still a good candidate b/c parasite fraction might be lower

Zymo Research DNA Elution Buffer is 10 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 0.1 mM EDTA

The composition of Buffer EB is: 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5
