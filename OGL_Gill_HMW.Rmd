# Summary

### Overview

Lycodes Concolor Gill Tissue was sourced from the Ocean Genome Legacy

details: sample A27970: gill in EDTA solution, flash frozen, put into the -80

### Planning

Extraction plan: Dry Ice Cryofracture of Tissues and Circulomics HMW DNA Extraction kit with modifications

-   aim for up to 50 mg of sample input

-   200 ul and 400 ul of cold Buffer CT (respectively in OOO, both below std amount)

-   centrifuge spins will be at 10G

-   warm EB to 70C to improve yield

Sample might have to be spun down slowly - *slurry concerns*

-   might skip cryofracture depending on how intact the sample is

##### Sequencing strategy

*Sample will be sent to Davis for Pac Bio Sequencing*

# Log

### 4/15/24

SB and I went to -80 to look at OGL sample. Observed sample to be frozen in EDTA.

#### Q's

-   should we thaw the sample, spin it down gently \*(what speed/duration is this) and remove the EDTA prior to cryofracture?

-   what will happen when we spin down the gill once thawed..will it produce a slurry?

-   after removal of EDTA should a PBS wash be done

    -   what effects could EDTA have on the downstream extraction steps? Proteinase inhibitor?

#### Next Steps

SB will email Rosie from the OGL to ask if this is a situation that she has insight on and what if any steps does she perform when a sample is flash frozen in EDTA

### Notes

Tissue selection: Fish skeletal muscle is not recommended if other fish tissues are available (e.g., heart, testes, fin clip, kidney)

Double input of sample if using skeletal muscle. Still a good candidate b/c parasite fraction might be lower
